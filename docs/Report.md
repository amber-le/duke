5. Errors Describe what kind of errors Duke can handle. E.g., give different types of incorrect commands (and the
   expected outputs) it can handle
    - If the user types in an invalid index, CrabY will show the error message and ask the user to type in a valid
      index.
   ```
   mark TIC2002
      Oops!!! Looks like you used the wrong format (â•¯ï¸µâ•°,)
      â•°â”ˆâž¤ Try with: mark [integer] e.g: mark 1
                or: mark all - to mark all the tasks in your list.
      â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ—¦â€¢âœ©â€¢â—¦â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆ
   ```
   ``` 
   mark 100
      Oops!!! Something wrong! Your list only have 1 âžž 3 tasks (â•¯ï¸µâ•°,)
      â•°â”ˆâž¤ Please try again with another number â˜˜
      â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ—¦â€¢âœ©â€¢â—¦â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆ
   ```
   **Note that:** CrabY can handle cases insensitive and multiple space in the input.

    - If the user types in an invalid date or time, CrabY will show the error message and ask the user to type in a
      valid
      date or time.
    ```
   test error date time /by 15 Nov 16:30
      Oops!!! Looks like you used the wrong format (â•¯ï¸µâ•°,)
      Please enter in this format after used /by or /from and /to
      â•°â”ˆâž¤ Try with: "/by dd/mm/yyyy hhmm" e.g: /by 12/12/2020 1800
                or: "/by mon" - CrabY will put the date to the next Monday
      â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ—¦â€¢âœ©â€¢â—¦â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆ
    ```
    - If the user puts the blank space in the description or just enter, CrabY will show the error message and ask the
      user to type in a
      valid description.
    ```
                       
      Oops!!! The description cannot be empty.
      â•°â”ˆâž¤Type "help" if you need to see the list of command
      â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ—¦â€¢âœ©â€¢â—¦â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆ
    ```
   ```
   /from tomorow
      Oops!!! The description cannot be empty.
      â•°â”ˆâž¤Type "help" if you need to see the list of command

   ```

    - If the user types in an invalid command, CrabY will still add to the task list.
    - Craby can handel 4 types of the date format, user can put the time or not, if the user doesn't put the time, CrabY
      will put the time to 12:00AM.
        - dd/mm/yyyy hhmm
        - yyyy/mm/dd hhmm
        - dd-mm-yyyy hhmm
        - yyyy-mm-dd hhmm
6. Delete Give examples of command(s) and expected outputs for deleting tasks.

   ```

7. Save Give a sample of the tasks as they are stored in the hard disk.
   ```

   D || 0 || TIC2002 - submit project || 19/11/2023 0000
   E || 0 || TIC2002 - sent draft to Prof. Damith || 08/11/2023 0000 || 15/11/2023 2359
   ```

8.Dates Give examples (i.e., screenshots of commands and outputs) of how your Duke uses dates/times in meaningful ways
i.e., what commands can use dates/times in meaningful ways? E.g., is it possible to list deadlines/events on a specific
day? Does it detect invalid dates given by the user?
- Easy to format 4 types of date format (dd/mm/yyyy hhmm, yyyy/mm/dd hhmm, dd-mm-yyyy hhmm, yyyy-mm-dd hhmm) to what I want to show to the user.
- If the event is on the same day, CrabY will show the date only once.
