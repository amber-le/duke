      valid
      date or time.
    ```

      Please enter in this format after used /by or /from and /to
      â•°â”ˆâž¤ Try with: "/by dd/mm/yyyy hhmm" e.g: /by 12/12/2020 1800
                or: "/by mon" - CrabY will put the date to the next Monday
      â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ—¦â€¢âœ©â€¢â—¦â”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆâ”ˆ
    ```

      user to type in a
      valid description.
    ```
                       
      Oops!!! The description cannot be empty.

   ```

8. Dates Give examples (i.e., screenshots of commands and outputs) of how your Duke uses dates/times in meaningful ways
   i.e., what commands can use dates/times in meaningful ways? E.g., is it possible to list deadlines/events on a

   day? Does it detect invalid dates given by the user?
    - Easy to format 4 types of date format (dd/mm/yyyy hhmm, yyyy/mm/dd hhmm, dd-mm-yyyy hhmm, yyyy-mm-dd hhmm) to what
      I want to show to the user.

11. Other features Describe other features you implement (i.e., not described above), if any e.g., optional increments.

    - When the system starts, the user can choose the checklist that they want to work on.
    - Reason for doing this feature: When I put a lot of tasks in the list, I want to separate them into different
      categories, so I can work on them one by one, and it will be easier to manage.
    - How to use this feature:
        + You can choose the checklist that they want to work on by typing the name of the checklist at the beginning
          of the program.
        + If you want to create a new checklist, they can type the name of the checklist that they want to create.
        + If you type in the name of an existing checklist, they can continue working on the checklist that already has the tasks they set before.
        + If you want to switch to another checklist, they can type `switch` and then enter. After that, the user
          can type the checklist name that they want to work on.
        + If you want to see all the checklists that they have created, they can type `checklists` and then enter.
          After that, you can see all the checklists that they have created.
